        <title>About the Techniques</title>

        <para>The accessibility techniques described in this document are advisory in nature. They are intended to help <link
                linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> create <link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB Publications</link>
            that conform to the requirements in <xref linkend="refA11Y"/>, but they are not all applicable in all situations
            and there may be other ways to meet the requirements of that specification. As a result, this document should not
            be read as providing prescriptive requirements.</para>

        <para>These techniques also do not address issues in digital publishing for which no universally accessible solutions
            exist. The W3C's Digital Publishing Interest Group has published a note that outlines many of these issues <xref
                linkend="refA11YNote"/>. As solutions become available, they will be incorporated into the appropriate
            document, whether this one or one it refers to.</para>

        <para>If Authors encounter issues that are not covered in these or related techniques, they are encouraged to report
            the issue to the appropriate community for guidance on how to meet accessibility standards. The <link
                xlink:href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/IG/">W3C Web Accessibility Interest Group</link> has a public mailing list
            where issues meeting <xref linkend="refWCAG20"/> and <xref linkend="refARIA11"/> requirements can be raised. The
            IDPF similarly has an <link xlink:href="http://idpf.org/forums/epub-accessibility">accessibility
            forum</link> where EPUB-related issues can be raised.</para>

    <chapter xml:id="sec-discovery">
        <title>Discovery Metadata Techniques</title>

        <section xml:id="meta-001" role="suppress-numbering">
            <title>META-001: Identify primary access modes</title>

            <para>An access mode is defined as a "human sense perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a user may
                process or perceive the content of a digital resource." <xref linkend="refISO24751-3"/> For example, if an
                    <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> contains images and video, visual perception is required to
                consume the content exactly as it was created.</para>

            <para>There are four access modes that are typically specified for EPUB Publications:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">textual</emphasis> — the publication contains text content (headings,
                        paragraphs, etc.).</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">visual</emphasis> — the publication contains visual content such as images,
                        graphics, diagrams, animations and video.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">auditory</emphasis> — the publication contains auditory content such as
                        standalone audio clips and audio soundtracks for video content.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis role="bold">tactile</emphasis> — the publication contains tactile content such as
                        embedded braille and tactile diagrams.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>In order for a user to determine whether an EPUB Publication is suitable for their needs, they need to know
                which of these access modes are required to consume the content. List all applicable access modes in the
                    <xref linkend="refSCHEMA-ORG"/> <link xlink:href="https://schema.org/accessMode"
                        ><markup>accessMode</markup> property</link>, repeating the property for each applicable mode.</para>

            <informalexample>
                <para>The following example shows the metadata entries for an EPUB 3 Publication that has textual and visual
                    access modes.</para>
                <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/accessmode01.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>Note that the access modes of the content do not reflect any adaptations that have been provided. For
                example, if a comic book also includes alternative text for each image, it does not have a textual access
                mode. See the following section on <link linkend="meta-002">sufficient access modes</link> for how to
                indicate that the available adaptations allow the content to be consumed in another mode.</para>

            <para>Refer to the <markup xlink:href="https://schema.org/accessMode">accessMode</markup> definition in <xref
                    linkend="refSCHEMA-ORG"/> for more information about this property and its values.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="meta-002" role="suppress-numbering">
            <title>META-002: Identify sufficient access modes</title>

            <para>The access modes sufficient to consume an <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> express a broader
                picture of the potential usability than do the <link linkend="meta-001">basic access modes</link>. Where the
                basic access modes identify the default nature of the media used in the publication, sufficient access modes
                identify which modes, or sets of modes, a user requires to read the publication. Sufficient access modes take
                into account the affordances and adaptations that have been provided, allowing a user to determine whether
                the content will be usable regardless of its default nature.</para>

            <para>Sufficient access modes are identified in the <xref linkend="refSCHEMA-ORG"/> <link
                    xlink:href="https://schema.org/accessModeSufficient"
                    ><markup>accessModeSufficient</markup> property</link>. Repeat the property for each set of sufficient
                access modes.</para>

            <para>For example, consider an EPUB Publication that contains graphics and charts, as well as descriptions for
                all these images. The publication has both textual and visual content, so the <xref linkend="gloss-author"/>
                will include the following metadata entries to indicate this:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/accessmode01.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>This metadata does not make clear whether a textual access mode is sufficient to read the entire
                publication, or whether a visual one is, only that two modes are required by default. This discrepancy is why
                sufficiency is also important to know.</para>

            <para>The first set of sufficiency metadata the Author inputs will establish the textual and visual
                requirement:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/accessmodesufficient01.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>The order in which the access modes are listed is not important. The only requirement is that they be
                separated by commas.</para>

            <para>Since the Author has also included descriptions for all the images, she can also indicate that a purely
                textual access mode is sufficient to read the content:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/accessmodesufficient02.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>Without this metadata, users would not have known that they could read the publication only via its text
                content.</para>

            <para>The full set of entries in this example is as follows:</para>

            <informalexample>
                <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/accessmodesufficient03.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>Note that sufficiency of access is often a subjective determination of the Author based on their
                understanding of what information is essential to comprehending the text. Some information loss occurs by not
                being able to view a video, for example, but the Author might regard the visual or auditory losses as
                inconsequential if a transcript provides all the necessary information to understand the concepts being
                conveyed.</para>

            <note>
                <para>The <property>accessModeSufficient</property> property, as defined in <xref linkend="refSCHEMA-ORG"/>,
                    allows more complicated expressions than can be represented in the EPUB 2 or 3 Package Document (e.g.,
                    defininition of lists of values and inclusion of a human-readable description). A future version of EPUB
                    might allow for richer metadata, but the basic expression shown in this section is sufficient for
                    discovery purposes.</para>

            <para>Identifying all the accessibility features and adaptations included in an <xref

                fine-grained level than the access modes do.</para>

            <para>For example, a math textbook might have a textual access mode, but that in itself does not indicate whether
                MathML markup is available. Whether a visual work only provides alternative text or whether it includes
                extended descriptions is also important to know when gauging its usability.</para>

            <para>The EPUB format requires that some accessibility features will always be present (e.g., a table of

            <para>There are three widely-recognized hazards that can affect readers of digital content:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>flashing — if a resource flashes more than three times a second, it can cause seizures (e.g.,
                        videos and animations). See also <xref linkend="refWCAG20"/> <link

                <listitem>
                    <para>motion simulation — if a resource simulates motion, it can cause a user to become nauseated (e.g.,
                        a video game drawn on the <xref linkend="refHTML"/> <link
                            xlink:href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element"
                                ><markup>canvas</markup> element</link>).</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>sound — certain sound patterns, such as ringing and buzzing, can cause seizures.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para><link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB Publications</link> have to report whether or not they contain
                resources that present any of these hazards to users, as they can have real physical effects.</para>

            <para>Hazards are identified in the <xref linkend="refSCHEMA-ORG"/> <link
                    xlink:href="https://schema.org/accessibilityHazard"><markup>accessibilityHazard</markup> property</link>.
                Repeat this property for each hazard.</para>

            <para>Unlike other accessibility properties, the presence of hazards can be expressed both positively and
                negatively. This design decision was made because users most often search for content that is free from
                hazards that affect them, but also want to know what dangers are present in any publications they
                discover.</para>

            <informalexample>
                <para>The following example shows the metadata entries for an EPUB 3 Publication that has a flashing hazard
                    but no motion simulation or sound hazards.</para>
                <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/accessibilityhazard01.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
            </informalexample>

            <para>Do not skip reporting hazards just because an EPUB Publication does not contain any content that could
                present risks. Users cannot infer a meaning when no metadata is present.</para>

                whichever platform they use (Windows, Mac, iOS, Linux, etc.). These APIs allow the Assistive Technology to
                communicate with the <xref linkend="gloss-reading-system"/> to read the text or control the interface, as
                needed.</para>

            <para><link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> of static content do not have to worry about this interaction,
                as the user's Reading System exposes the necessary information to the accessibility APIs (provided it has
                been developed to be accessible). Authors who create EPUB Publications that contain dynamic content — such as
                scripting and custom controls — do need to pay attention to the compatibility of such content, as Assistive
                Technologies may not receive sufficient information to provide an accessible interface.</para>

            <para>In the case of scripted content, the static picture of the content that an Assistive Technology initially

                    <xref linkend="refHTML"/> form elements (e.g., buttons and inputs), Authors often create custom elements
                whose state is opaque without correct use of <xref linkend="refARIA11"/> roles, state and properties  (e.g.,

                        linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> typically spans multiple documents. It is consequently essential
                    not only that each <xref linkend="gloss-content-doc"/> has a meaningful order, but that the order is
                    meaningful from document to document.</para>

                <para>Authors also need to ensure that they identify whether items in the spine contain primary or

                        2.4.5</link> requires there be more than one way to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages. By
                    default, <link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB Publications</link> meet this WCAG requirement so
                    long as <link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> follow the EPUB requirements to <link
                        xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/packages#sec-spine-elem">include all EPUB Content
                        Documents in the spine</link> and <link
                        xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/packages#sec-itemref-elem">ensure access to all
                        non-linear documents</link> <xref linkend="refPackagesLatest"/>.</para>

                <para>The reason an EPUB Publication passes by meeting these requirements has to do with differences in how a
                    user interacts with the set of documents in an EPUB Publication. In particular, although an EPUB
                    Publication typically consists of many <link linkend="gloss-content-doc">Content Documents</link>, <link
                        linkend="gloss-reading-system">Reading Systems</link> automatically provide the ability for the user
                    to move seamlessly from one document to the next, so long as they are listed in the <link
                        xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/packages#sec-spine-elem">spine</link> <xref
                        linkend="refPackagesLatest"/>. To the user, an EPUB Publication is a single document they have
                    complete access to, not a set of disconnected pages that they need links to move through.</para>

                <para>The required table of contents provides a second method to access the major headings of the
                    publication. The user can jump to any heading and continue to navigate from there, regardless of how the
                    publication is chunked.</para>

                <para>Following these two requirements therefore satisfies the need for multiple ways to access the content.
                    Reading Systems also typically provide search capabilities, something the Author cannot provide, so users
                    also have a third option available in most cases.</para>

                <para>Although Authors only need to follow EPUB requirements to meet this criteria, they are still encouraged
                    to provide additional methods to improve access beyond the minimum. Some suggestions include:</para>

                    <title>Note About the Table of Contents</title>

                    <para>A common question about the EPUB table of contents is what completeness it needs to have with
                        respect to the headings of the publication. Although the obvious answer seems like it should be a
                        simple aggregation of all headings for all sections, practically there are a number of usability
                        challenges to this approach.</para>

                    <para>Factors such as device screen sizes can make the table of contents for publications with a deep
                        hierarchy of headings unreadable, so <link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> will trim headings
                        below a certain depth to improve the readability. Further, <link linkend="gloss-reading-system"
                            >Reading Systems</link> do not always provide structured access to the headings in the table of
                        contents, or provide shortcuts to navigate the links. The result is that users have to listen to each
                        link one at a time to find where they want to go, a tedious and time-consuming process.</para>

                    <para>Although it is expected that Reading Systems will improve access to the table of contents as
                        accessibility support for EPUB evolves — making complete tables of contents usable by everyone —
                        there are legitimate usability reasons why they are not provided now.</para>

                    <para>When Authors choose not to provide links to all the headings, however, they should optimize the
                        linking they do provide for the best overall reading experience. Some considerations on how to
                        achieve this include:</para>

                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>ensuring that there is at least one link to every <xref linkend="gloss-content-doc"/> —
                                allowing the user to reach each document simplifies navigation to the minor headings within
                                them;</para>
                        </listitem>

                            <para>only omitting minor headings from the table of contents — although a subjective decision,
                                there is often a level of diminishing value for navigation (e.g., fourth level and lower
                                headings often only delimit short subsections on a topic).</para>

                    Assistive Technologies to automatically scan the markup and compile a list of <link linkend="sem-003"

                <para>The <markup>role</markup> attribute is similar in nature to the <link

                            ><markup>type</markup> attribute</link> <xref linkend="refContentDocsLatest"/>, which provides
                    additional semantic information to enable EPUB Reading System behaviors.</para>

                <informalexample>
                    <para>The following example shows the epub:type attribute used to provide additional semantic

                </informalexample>

                <para>The key difference between these attributes is that the <markup>role</markup> attribute bridges
                    accessibility while the <markup>type</markup> attribute provides hooks to enable Reading System
                    behaviors. Omitting roles lessens the accessibility for users of Assistive Technologies, in other words,
                    while omitting types diminishes certain functionality in <link linkend="gloss-reading-system">Reading
                        Systems</link> (e.g., pop-up footnotes or special presentations of the content).</para>

                <para>Since each attribute offers different advantages, it is recommended that both be used whenever
                    applicable to provide the best reading experience for all readers.</para>

                <para>It is often the case that the attributes will have have corresponding semantics. In these situations,
                    it is recommended that both attributes be attached to an element.</para>

                <title>SEM-002: Do not repeat semantics across chunked content</title>

                <para>Although <link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB Publications</link> appear as single contiguous
                    documents to users when read, they are typically composed of many individual <link
                        linkend="gloss-content-doc">EPUB Content Documents</link>. This practice keeps the amount of markup
                    that has to be rendered small to reduce the load time in <link linkend="gloss-reading-system">Reading
                        Systems</link> (i.e., to minimize the time the user has to wait for a document to appear). It is
                    rare, at least for books, for an EPUB Publication to contain only one Content Document with all the
                    content in it.</para>

                <para>When content is chunked in this way, it often requires the Author to make decisions about how best to
                    restructure the information. A part, for example, will typically not include all the chapters that belong
                    to it. The Author will instead separate the part heading from each chapter, putting each into a separate
                    document.</para>

                <para>Although visually these restructuring decisions can be hidden from readers, they impact the
                    functionality of <link linkend="gloss-at">Assistive Technologies</link>. In the case of <xref
                        linkend="refARIA11"/> roles, the result is that only the subset present in the currently-loaded EPUB
                    Content Document are exposed to users. An Assistive Technology cannot provide a list of landmarks for the
                    whole publication, as it cannot see outside the current document.</para>

                <para>To counteract this destructuring effect, <link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> sometimes think to
                    re-add or re-identify structures in the belief that having this information in every document will be
                    helpful to users (e.g., adding an extra <xref linkend="refHTML"/> <markup>section</markup> element around
                    a chapter to indicate it belongs to a part, or putting the part semantic on the
                    <markup>body</markup> tag). All this practice does, however, is add repetition that is not only
                    disruptive when reading, but can actually make the structure of the publication harder to follow. Authors
                    are therefore advised not to attempt to rebuild structures in these ways.</para>

                <para>For example, consider a book that has five parts and each part contains five chapters. Structurally,
                    each chapter belongs to its part (i.e., is grouped with it), as in the following markup:</para>

                <informalexample>
                    <synopsis><xi:include href="examples/a11y/sem002-01.xml" parse="text"/></synopsis>
                </informalexample>

                <para>Since this would lead to a large content file, the part heading is typically split out into its own
                    Content Document so that it will appear on its own page:</para>

                <para>Each chapter is then separated into a separate Content Document:</para>

                <para>It is not necessary to add a part wrapper to each chapter, as in the following example:</para>

                <para>Doing so introduces a new <property>part</property> landmark into each document, which will cause an

                        linkend="refPackagesLatest"/>: both are designed to provide users with quick access to the major
                    structures of a document, such as chapters, glossaries and indexes. ARIA landmarks are compiled
                    automatically by <link linkend="gloss-at">Assistive Technologies</link> from the <link linkend="sem-001"
                        >roles</link> that have been applied to the markup, so <link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link>
                    only need to follow the requirement to include roles for the landmarks to be made available to
                    users.</para>

                <para>Although automatic generation of ARIA landmarks simplifies authoring, it also means that ARIA landmarks
                    are limited to how the <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> has been chunked up into <link
                        linkend="gloss-content-doc">Content Documents</link>. An Assistive Technology can only present the
                    landmarks available in the currently-loaded document; it cannot provide a complete picture of all the
                    landmarks in a multi-document publication (see the <link linkend="sem-002">previous section</link> for
                    more discussion about content chunking).</para>

                <para>EPUB landmarks, on the other hand, are compiled by the Author prior to distribution, and are not
                    directly linked to the use of the <link
                        xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/31/spec/epub-contentdocs.html#sec-epub-type-attribute"
                            ><markup>type</markup> attribute</link> <xref linkend="refContentDocsLatest"/> in the content.
                    They are designed to simplify linking to major sections of the publication in a machine-readable way, as
                        <link linkend="gloss-reading-system">Reading Systems</link> do not scan the entire publication for
                    landmarks, either. EPUB landmarks are typically not as numerous as ARIA landmarks, as Reading Systems
                    only expose so many of these navigation aids.</para>

                <para>Given these differences in application, however, it is important to include EPUB landmarks and not rely
                    only on the presence of ARIA roles to facilitate navigation, and vice versa. Each aids navigation in its
                    own way.</para>

                <para>The EPUB specification does not require that Authors include a specific set of landmarks, but it is
                    recommended to include a link to the start of the body matter as well as to any major reference sections
                    (e.g., table of contents, endnotes, bibliography, glossary, index).</para>

                <para>To a user, an <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> appears as a single document that they read from
                    beginning to end, even though the content is often split across numerous <link
                        linkend="gloss-content-doc">EPUB Content Documents</link>. As a result, their natural expectation is
                    that the headings reflect their position in the overall hierarchy of the publication, despite the
                    publication not actually being a single document (e.g., if a part heading is expressed in an <xref
                        linkend="refHTML"/> <markup>h1</markup> element, each chapter that belongs to the part will have
                        an <markup>h2</markup> heading).</para>

                        Organizing a page using headings</link> instructs <link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> on
                    correctly using numbered headings within a document, but with EPUB Publications the numbered headings
                    also need to remain consistent across documents. Practically, this means that each EPUB Content Document
                    does not have to begin with an <markup>h1</markup> heading unless the first heading is a top-level
                    heading — the first heading needs to have a numbered heading element that reflects its actual position in
                    the publication.</para>

                <para>Authors also to need chunk their content so that the first heading in a document always has the highest
                    number. For example, if a document starts with an <markup>h3</markup> heading, there shouldn't be
                        an <markup>h2</markup> heading later in the document (e.g., do not include the start of a new section
                    with the trailing subsections of the previous). It is acceptable for there to be subsequent headings at
                    the same level as the first (e.g., multiple subsections in one document could all have
                        <markup>h3</markup> headings).</para>

                <informalexample>
                    <para>The following example shows two consecutive EPUB Content Documents in a textbook. The first
                        contains a section heading (<markup>h2</markup>) and the first two subsections (<markup>h3</markup>).
                        The second contains the final two subsections (<markup>h3</markup>).</para>

                    that text equivalents be provided for all non-text content to meet Level A. In some regions (e.g., Asia),
                    it is not uncommon to find images of individual text characters, despite the availability of Unicode
                    character equivalents. This practice occurs for various reasons, such as ease of translation of older
                    documents and for compatibility across <link linkend="gloss-reading-system">Reading Systems</link>.The
                    use of images in most instances leads to the text not being accessible to non-visual users, however. </para>

                <para>When individual characters are replaced by images, there is invariably a negative effect on
                    text-to-speech playback, even when alternative text is provided (e.g., if single characters within a word
                    are replaced by images, the word will not be read as a single unit of text). It is also problematic for
                    visual users, as the images often scale poorly and the characters cannot be changed to different font
                    families to meet user preferences.</para>

                <para>The use of Unicode characters for all text content avoids this problem, allowing content to
                    successfully meet the minimum requirement for Level A.</para>

                <para>For compliance with Level AA, Authors are directed to <link

            <para>As <link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB Publications</link> can be composed of more than one <xref
                    linkend="gloss-rendition"/>, it is possible that different versions of the content will have different
                levels of accessibility. For example, an image-based version of the content that lacks alternative text or
                descriptions could be bundled with a WCAG-compliant text-based serialization. This type of accessible
                bundling is acceptable, as <xref linkend="refWCAG20"/> allows non-conforming content provided a <link
                    xlink:href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conforming-alternate-versiondef">conforming alternate
                    version</link> is available.</para>

            <para>The <xref linkend="refMULTIPLEREND"/> specification defines a set of features for creating these types of
                EPUB Publications. In particular, it specifies a set of attributes that allow a <xref
                    linkend="gloss-reading-system"/> to automatically select a preferred Rendition for the user, or to
                provide the user the option to manually select between the available options. This functionality technically
                meets the requirements of <xref linkend="refWCAG20"/> in terms of ensuring the user can access the accessible
                version.</para>

            <para>In practice, however, the <xref linkend="refMULTIPLEREND"/> specification is not broadly supported in
                Reading Systems at the time of publication. As a result, a user who obtains an EPUB Publication that contains
                more than one Rendition will only have access to the <xref linkend="gloss-default-rendition"/>. Unless this
                Rendition is the accessible one, the EPUB Publication might not be readable by them.</para>

            <para><link linkend="gloss-author">Authors</link> therefore need to use their best discretion when implementing
                this functionality to meet accessibility requirements. EPUB Publications that contain multiple renditions are
                conformant to the <xref linkend="refA11Y"/> specification if at least one Rendition meets all the content
                requirements, but Authors at a minimum need to note that a Reading System that supports multiple renditions
                is required in their <link linkend="meta-005">accessibility summary</link>. Any other methods the Author can
                use to make this dependence known is advisable (e.g., in the <link linkend="dist-002">distribution
                    metadata</link>).</para>

            <para>This section will be updated with techniques for using multiple renditions when there is enough support in
                Reading Systems to broadly recommend their use.</para>

                <para>A <markup>title</markup> or <markup>aria-label</markup> attribute is required on the element, as it
                    provides the value that is announced to the user. Do not include the page number as text content, as this
                    practice forces the user to hear it announced wherever it occurs (e.g., without any context in the middle
                    of a sentence).</para>

                <para>EPUB 2 does not include markup to identify static page break marks in the content. Page break

                    audio playback of a publication it is not only distracting, but can be confusing, as well (e.g., the

            <title>DIST-001: Do not restrict access through digital rights management</title>

            <para><link linkend="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB Publications</link> typically require preservation of the
                publisher's and author's intellectual property when distributed (e.g., so that they can be made available for
                individual sale through online bookstores or distributed through library systems). The most common way to
                address this need has been through the application of digital rights management (DRM) schemes to the packaged
                EPUB Publication. DRM enables a variety of security features that aren't native to the EPUB format, such as
                the ability to limit access to a single user and to limit the length of time the person can access the
                publication (e.g., library loans).</para>

            <para>In general, DRM can be made to work interoperably with <link linkend="gloss-at">Assistive
                    Technologies</link>, but problems arise when DRM restrictions remove direct access to an EPUB Publication
                or restrict access to the content within it. Unless the Reading System implementing the DRM provides API
                level access to the content, it can prove difficult, or even impossible, to generate text-to-speech playback,
                or for a refreshable braille display to have access to the underlying text, as well as cause other
                accessibility issues.</para>

            <para>The application of digital rights management therefore must not impair or impede the functionality of
                Assistive Technologies on EPUB Publications users have the right to access.</para>

            <para>When an <xref linkend="gloss-epub-publication"/> is ingested into a distribution system, such as a
                bookstore or library, a metadata record is often provided separately to the distributor. In these scenarios,
                the metadata used to enable discovery of the publication typically comes from the distribution record alone,
                not from the metadata in the Package Document.</para>

            <para>The result is that it is necessary to include as much accessibility metadata in distribution records as
                their vocabularies allow.</para>

            <note>
                <para>The use of distribution records does not remove the requirement to include accessibility metadata in
                    the Package Document. The metadata in the Package Document ensures accessibility information is always
