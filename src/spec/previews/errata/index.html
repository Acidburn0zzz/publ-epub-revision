      <h1>Errata for EPUB Previews 1.0</h1>
      <p>This page lists errata for the <a href="../epub-previews.html">EPUB Previews 1.0</a> specification.</p>
      <section>
         <h2>2.5 Identifiers</h2>
         <p>The second paragraph recommends that an ISBN not be used as the unique identifier for a Preview Publication.
            Although technically not forbidding the inclusion of an ISBN, the statement has been read to imply that ISBNs
            are not appropriate for previews, when, in fact, they are commonly used by publishers for previews.</p>
         <p>A future update to the specification will remove the second paragraph and may replace it with guidance
            not to use the same identifiers between preview and full publication.</p>
