        <para>This section covers the major features of EPUB, including important components and topics that apply to the
            process of authoring <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-epub-publication">EPUB
                Publication</olink>s as a whole.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-package-file">
            <title>Package Document</title>

            <para>Each <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-rendition">Rendition</olink> of an EPUB
                Publication includes a single <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-package-document"
                    >Package Document</olink>, which specifies all the resources required to render that Rendition. The
                Package Document also defines a reading order for linear consumption, and associates metadata and navigation
                information for the Rendition.</para>

            <para>The Package Document represents a significant improvement on a typical Web site. A Web site, for example,
                embeds references to its resources within its content, which, while a simple and flexible means of
                identifying resources, makes it difficult to enumerate all the resources required to render it. In addition,
                there is no standard way for a Web site to define that a sequence of pages make up a larger publication,
                which is precisely what EPUB's <markup><olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-spine-elem"
                        type="epub-spec">spine</olink></markup> element does (i.e., it provides an external declarative means
                to explicitly specify navigation through a collection of documents). Finally, the Package Document defines a
                standard way to represent metadata globally applicable to a collection of pages.</para>

            <para>The Package Document also includes a <markup><olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-collection-elem"
                        type="epub-spec">collection</olink></markup> element, which allows grouping of logically-related
                    <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-publication-resource-cmt-or-foreign"
                    >Publication Resources</olink>. This element exists to enable the development of specialized content
                identification, processing and rendering features, such as the ability to define embedded preview content, or
                assemble an index or dictionary from its constituent XHTML Content Documents.</para>

            <para>The Package Document and other Rendition-specific constructs are specified in <xref linkend="refPackages3"
                />.</para>

            <title>Navigation</title>

            <section xml:id="sec-nav-order">
                <title>Reading Order</title>

                <para>A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB Publication consists of multiple resources that can be completely
                    navigated and consumed by a person or program <emphasis role="italic">in some specific
                    order</emphasis>.</para>

                <para>Many types of publication have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their content.
                    A novel is an example of a highly sequential document — it typically has a beginning, middle and end —
                    but not all publications are so ordered: a cookbook or collection of photographic images might be
                    considered to be more like a database. All documents do, however, have at least one logical ordering of
                    all their top-level content items, whether by date, topic, location or some other criteria (e.g., a
                    cookbook is typically ordered by type of recipe).</para>

                <para>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication defines at least one such logical ordering of all its top-level
                    content (the <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-spine-elem" type="epub-spec"/>), as well as a
                    declarative table of contents (the <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec"
                        targetptr="gloss-content-document-epub-nav">EPUB Navigation Document</olink>
                    <xref linkend="refEPUB3"/>). EPUB Publications make these data structures available in a machine-readable
                    way <emphasis role="italic">external</emphasis> to the content, simplifying their discovery and
                    use.</para>

                <para>EPUB Publications are not limited to the linear ordering of their contents, nor do they preclude
                    linking in arbitrary ways — just like the Web, EPUB Publications are built on hypertext — but the basic
                    consumption and navigation can be reliably accomplished in a way that is not true for a set of HTML
                    pages.</para>

            </section>

            <section xml:id="sec-nav-nav-doc">
                <title>Navigation Document</title>

                <para>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication contains a special XHTML Content Document called the <olink
                        type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-content-document-epub-nav">EPUB Navigation
                        Document</olink>, which uses the HTML5 <markup>nav</markup> element to define human- and
                    machine-readable navigation information.</para>

                <para>The Navigation Document supersedes the NCX document <xref linkend="refOPS2"/>, and the inclusion of NCX
                    documents is only recommended for forward compatibility in older Reading Systems. The Navigation
                    Document, while maintaining the baseline accessibility and navigation support and features of the NCX,
                    introduces new functionality and rendering features to enhance navigation for all Users. Prime among
                    these are better support for internationalization (as an XHTML5 document itself, the Navigation Document
                    natively supports ruby annotations) and support for embedded grammars (MathML and SVG can be included
                    within navigation links).</para>

                <para>As XHTML Content Documents, Navigation Documents also provide a flexible means of tailoring the
                    navigation display using CSS and the <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-rendition-nav-def-hidden"
                        type="epub-spec">hidden attribute</olink> while not impacting access to information for accessible
                    Reading Systems.</para>

                <para>The structure and semantics of Navigation Documents are defined in <olink targetdoc="packages"
                        targetptr="sec-rendition-nav" type="epub-spec"/>.</para>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-linking">
            <title>Linking</title>

            <para>The new EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier (epubcfi) Specification <xref linkend="refEPUBCFI"/> defines a
                standardized method for linking into an EPUB Publication. </para>

            <para>Required support for this scheme in Reading Systems means that EPUB now has an interoperable linking
                mechanism, one that can, for example, facilitate the sharing of bookmarks and reading locations across
                devices.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-metadata">
            <title>Metadata</title>

            <para>EPUB Publications provide a rich array of options for adding metadata. Each Rendition's Package Document
                includes a dedicated <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-metadata-elem" type="epub-spec">metadata
                    section</olink> for general information about the EPUB Publication, allowing titles, authors, identifiers
                and other information about the EPUB Publication to be easily accessed. It also provides the means to attach
                complete bibliographic records using the <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-link-elem"
                    type="epub-spec">link element</olink>.</para>

            <para>The Package Document also allows a <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec"
                    targetptr="gloss-unique-identifier">Unique Identifier</olink> to be established for the EPUB Publication
                using the <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="attrdef-package-unique-identifier" type="epub-spec"
                    >unique-identifier attribute</olink>. The required last-modified date in the Package metadata section can
                be joined with this identifier to define a <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec"
                    targetptr="gloss-release-identifier">Release Identifier</olink>, which provides a means of distinguishing
                different versions of an EPUB Publication (see <olink targetdoc="packages"
                    targetptr="sec-package-metadata-identifiers" type="epub-spec"/>). The Package Identifier addresses the
                issue of how to release an EPUB Publication without changing its Unique Identifier while still identifying it
                as a new version.</para>

            <para>XHTML Content Documents also include the means of annotating document markup with rich metadata, making
                them more semantically meaningful and useful both for processing and accessibility purposes (<olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection" type="epub-spec"/>). Both RDFa and
                Microdata attributes can also be used in XHTML Content Documents, enabling content-level metadata expressions
                    (<olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-semantic-enrichment" type="epub-spec"/>).</para>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-content-docs">
            <title>Content Documents</title>

            <para>Each Rendition of an EPUB Publication contains one or more <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec"
                    targetptr="gloss-content-document-epub">EPUB Content Documents</olink>, as defined in <xref
                    linkend="refEPUB3"/>. These are XHTML or SVG documents that describe the readable content and reference
                associated media resources (e.g., images, audio and video clips).</para>

            <para><olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-content-document-epub-xhtml">XHTML Content
                    Documents</olink> are defined by a profile of HTML5 that requires the use of XML serialization <xref
                    linkend="refHTML5"/> in order to ensure that content can be reliably manipulated and rendered. This
                profile also adds two additional EPUB-specific language constructs: the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="attrdef-epub-type" type="epub-spec">epub:type attribute</olink> for element-level metadata and
                the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-epub-trigger" type="epub-spec">epub:trigger
                    element</olink> for declaratively associating controls with multimedia elements.</para>

            <para>These additions do not affect the ability of an HTML5 User Agent <xref linkend="refHTML5"/> to render XHTML
                Content Documents, but EPUB Publications might not render identically in all User Agents depending on their
                support.</para>

        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-fxl">
            <title>Fixed Layouts</title>

            <para>Although EPUB's history is steeped in enabling reflowable content, not all publications lend themselves
                easily to reflowing. Children's books, comics and manga, magazines and many other content forms require the
                ability to create page-precise layouts to be represented in a meaningful fashion.</para>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 includes metadata that allows the creation of <olink targetdoc="packages"
                    targetptr="sec-package-metadata-fxl" type="epub-spec">fixed-layout XHTML Content Documents</olink>, in
                addition to existing capabilities for fixed layouts in SVG. This metadata enables the <olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-fxl-xhtml-svg-dimensions" type="epub-spec">dimensions of the
                    page</olink> to be controlled, creating a canvas on which elements can be absolutely positioned.</para>

            <para>The metadata does not just flag whether content is to be fixed or reflowed, but also allows Authors to
                specify the desired <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="fxl-property-orientation" type="epub-spec"
                    >orientation of pages</olink>, when to <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="fxl-property-spread"
                    type="epub-spec">create synthetic spreads</olink>, and <olink targetdoc="packages"
                    targetptr="fxl-properties-page-spread" type="epub-spec">how to position pages</olink> within those
                spreads, providing a broad range of control over the presentation of EPUB Publications.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-rendering">
            <title>Rendering and CSS</title>

            <para>A key concept of EPUB is that content presentation adapts to the User, rather than the User having to adapt
                to a particular presentation of content. HTML was originally designed to support dynamic rendering of
                structured content, but over time HTML as supported in Web browsers has become focused on the needs of Web
                applications, and most popular Web sites now have fixed-format layouts.</para>

            <para>EPUB Publications, however, are designed to maximize accessibility for the visually impaired, and Reading
                Systems typically perform text line layout and pagination on the fly, adapting to the size of the display
                area, the User's preferred font size, and other environmental factors. This behavior is not guaranteed in
                EPUB; images, vector graphics, video and other non-reflowable content might be included, and some Reading
                Systems might not paginate on the fly, or at all. Nevertheless, supporting dynamic adaptive layout and
                accessibility has been a primary design consideration throughout the evolution of the EPUB standard.</para>

            <para>EPUB Content Documents can reference CSS Style Sheets, allowing Authors to define the desired rendering
                properties. EPUB 3.1 defines a profile of CSS based on CSS 2.1 <xref linkend="refCSS21"/> for this purpose,

                EPUB.</para>

            <para>CSS3 properties were selected based on their current level of support in Web browsers, but support for them
                in Reading Systems and User Agents is not guaranteed (EPUB-defined properties can similarly be
                ignored).</para>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 also supports CSS styles that enable both horizontal and vertical layout and both left-to-right and
                right-to-left writing, but Reading Systems might not support all of these capabilities. Reading Systems might
                also support different rendering options than the Author intended. Refer to <xref linkend="sec-gls-css"/> in
                the Global Language Support section for more information.</para>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 also supports the ability to include multiple style sheets that allow users, for example, to select
                between day/night reading modes or to change the rendering direction of the text. Refer to <property

                these elements provide. (For information on supported audio formats, please refer to <olink targetdoc="spec"

                    linkend="refWOFF"/> — to accommodate both traditional publishing workflows and emerging Web-based
                workflows. Word processing programs used to create EPUB Publications are likely to have access only to a
                collection of installed OpenType fonts, for example, whereas Web-archival EPUB generators will likely only
                have access to WOFF resources (which cannot be converted to OpenType without undesirable, and potentially
                unlicensed, stripping of WOFF metadata).</para>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 also supports both obfuscated and regular font resources for both OpenType and WOFF font formats.
                Support for obfuscated font resources is required to accommodate font licensing restrictions for many

        <section xml:id="sec-scripting">
            <title>Scripting</title>

            <para>EPUB strives to treat content <emphasis role="italic">declaratively</emphasis> — as data that can be
                manipulated, not programs to be executed — but does support scripting as defined in <link linkend="refHTML5"
                    >HTML5</link> and <link linkend="refSVG">SVG</link> (refer to <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"

            <para>It is important to note, however, that scripting support is optional for Reading Systems and might be
                disabled for security reasons.</para>

            <para>Authors need to be aware that scripting in an EPUB Publication can create security considerations that are
                different from scripting within a Web browser. For example, typical same-origin policies are not applicable
                to content that has been downloaded to a User's local system. Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that
                scripting be limited to container constrained contexts, as further described in <olink
                    targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-scripted-content-content-reqs" type="epub-spec"/>.</para>

            <para>In other words, consider limiting scripting to cases where it is essential to the User experience, since it
                greatly increases the likelihood that content will not be portable across all Reading Systems and creates
                barriers to accessibility and content reusability.</para>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 does not require that Reading Systems come with any particular set of built-in system fonts. As
                occurs in Web contexts, Users in a particular locale might have installed fonts that omit characters required
                for other locales, and Reading Systems might utilize intrinsic fonts or font engines that do not utilize
                operating system installed fonts. As a result, the text content of an EPUB Publication might not natively
                render as intended on all Reading Systems.</para>

            <para>To address this problem, EPUB 3.1 supports the embedding of fonts to facilitate the rendering of text
                content, and this practice is recommended in order to ensure content is rendered as intended.</para>

    <chapter xml:id="sec-accessibility">
        <title>Accessibility</title>

        <para>A major goal of EPUB is to facilitate content accessibility, and a variety of features in EPUB 3.1 support this
            requirement. This section reviews these features, detailing some established best practices for ensuring that
            EPUB Publications are accessible where applicable.</para>

        <para>It is important to note that while accessibility is important in its own right, accessible content is also more
            valuable content: an accessible EPUB Publication will be adaptable to more devices and be easier to reuse, in
            whole or in part, via human and automated workflows. The EPUB Working Group strongly recommends that Authors
            ensure that they generate accessible content.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-nav">
            <title>Navigation</title>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 improves on NCX documents with the addition of <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec"
                    targetptr="gloss-content-document-epub-nav">EPUB Navigation Document</olink>s. As noted in <xref
                    linkend="sec-nav-nav-doc"/> above, the new navigation features represent a more universal and flexible
                navigation system.</para>

            <para>Navigation by table of contents is not exclusively an accessibility issue, but a complete table of contents
                ensures all Users can easily and fully access the contents of an EPUB Publication. The primary <olink
                    targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-rendition-nav-def-types-toc" type="epub-spec">toc nav element</olink>
                has to fully reflect the structure of the EPUB Publication to provide this functionality, otherwise
                navigation gets compromised for some Users.</para>

            <para>The Navigation Document can also be reused in the body of an EPUB Publication by including it in the
                    <markup>spine</markup>. To avoid the situation in highly structured documents where it might not be
                desirable to display the complete table of contents to Users in the body, the display level can be modified
                using the <xref linkend="refHTML5"/>
                <property>hidden</property> attribute. This attribute is ignored by Reading Systems when they render the
                table of contents outside the <markup>spine</markup> (e.g., in their own specialized views), which avoids
                minimizing the information that is available.</para>

            <para>Authors are also encouraged to supply additional <markup>nav</markup> elements if their EPUB Publications
                contain non-structural points of interest, such as figures, tables, etc. in order to further enhance access
                to the content.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-semantic-markup">
            <title>Semantic Markup</title>
            <para>HTML5 supports a number of new elements intended to make markup more semantically meaningful (e.g.,
                    <markup>section</markup>, <markup>nav</markup> and <markup>aside</markup>) and introduces more clearly
                defined semantics for some HTML4 elements. Make use of these elements, in conjunction with best practices for
                authoring well-structured Web content, when creating EPUB XHTML Content Documents. These additions allow
                content to be better grouped and defined, both for representing the structure of documents and to facilitate
                their logical navigation. XHTML Content Documents also natively support the inclusion of ARIA role and state
                attributes and events, enhancing the ability of Assistive Technologies to interact with the content.</para>
            <para>EPUB 3.1 further introduces the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="attrdef-epub-type" type="epub-spec"

                    linkend="refPFRoleAttribute"/>. This attribute allows any element in an XHTML Content Document to include
                additional information about its purpose and meaning within the work, using controlled vocabularies and
                terms. Refer to <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-semantic-inflection" type="epub-spec"/>
                for more information.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-layout">
            <title>Dynamic Layouts</title>

            <para>The design center of EPUB is dynamic layout: content is typically intended to be formatted on the fly
                rather than being typeset in a paginated manner in advance (i.e., expecting a particular sized "page"). This
                core capability is useful, for example, for optimizing rendering onto different sized device screens or
                window sizes, and it facilitates and simplifies content accessibility. </para>

            <para>While it is possible to incorporate more highly formatted content in EPUB — for example via bitmap images
                or SVG graphics, or even use of CSS explicit positioning and/or table elements to achieve particular visual
                layouts — Authors are strongly discouraged from utilizing such techniques. They are not reliable in EPUB
                since many Reading Systems render content in a paginated manner rather than creating a single scrolling
                    <olink type="epub-spec" targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-viewport">Viewport</olink> and since each
                Reading System might define its own pagination algorithm. If these techniques are necessary to convey the
                content of the publication, consider including <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="sec-foreign-restrictions"
                    type="epub-spec">fallbacks</olink> (e.g., for graphic novels).</para>

            <para>In general, it is preferable to achieve visual richness by using CSS Style Sheets without absolute sizing
                or positioning.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-aria-describedat">
            <title>Content Descriptions</title>

            <para>Although descriptions are commonly associated with image-based content, the ability to describe any complex

                <markup>aria-describedat</markup> attribute can be used to reference descriptions in another file (which can

        <section xml:id="sec-access-overlays">
            <title>Aural Renditions and Media Overlays</title>

            <para>Aural renderings of content are important for accessibility and are a desirable feature for many other
                Users. A baseline to facilitate aural rendering is to utilize semantic HTML designed for dynamic layout.
                Refer to <xref linkend="sec-tts"/> for more information on how to use the native facilities that EPUB XHTML
                Documents include. </para>

            <para>Media Overlays provide the ability to synchronize the text and audio content of an EPUB Publication, a
                feature already familiar to readers of DAISY Digital Talking Books. Overlays transcend the accessibility
                domain in their usefulness: the synchronization of text and audio as a tool for learning to read, for
                example, being of benefit in many circumstances. </para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-fallbacks">
            <title>Fallbacks</title>
            <para>Not all formats are accessible in their native format, and not all Users prefer to read in the default
                format provided. EPUB defines a variety of means for providing fallbacks so that alternate renderings can be
                made available in these cases.</para>

            <para>Publication- and content-level fallbacks are defined in <olink targetdoc="spec"
                    targetptr="sec-foreign-restrictions" type="epub-spec"/>. These fallback mechanisms enable the inclusion
                of Foreign Resources in an EPUB Publication and ensure compatibility of EPUB 3.1 content across Reading Systems
                with varying capabilities (e.g., they allow the inclusion of multiple video formats, and the inclusion of
                XHTML fallbacks to SVG Content Documents for EPUB 2 Reading Systems).</para>
            <para>The <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-epub-switch" type="epub-spec">switch
                    element</olink> similarly provides fallback capabilities for markup-level content features that might not
                be supported in some Reading Systems (e.g., to enable the inclusion of ChemML in EPUB 3.1 Reading Systems, or
                to provide an alternative to MathML for EPUB 2 Reading Systems).</para>
            <para>In addition, multiple instances of a complete work can be delivered in a single EPUB Publication by
                defining multiple <markup>rootfile</markup> elements in the OCF container file (as described in <olink
                    targetdoc="ocf" targetptr="sec-container-metainf-container.xml" type="epub-spec"/>). These alternate
                Rendition fallbacks might be used, for example, so that a formatted graphic novel defined via a sequence of
                SVG pages can be accompanied by an accessible text version defined via XHTML.</para>

        <section xml:id="sec-access-scripting">
            <title>Scripting</title>

            <para>EPUB 3.1 adopts a progressive enhancement approach for scripted content, whereby scripting has to not
                interfere with the integrity of the document (i.e., not result in information loss when scripting is not
                available). Consequently, although documents that do employ scripting <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                    targetptr="sec-scripted-content" type="epub-spec">can provide fallbacks</olink> to further facilitate
                access to their contents, the documents have to be accessible without them.</para>

            <para>Several mechanisms in EPUB can further minimize and constrain scripting within EPUB Publications to improve
                accessibility:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para> The declarative <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-epub-trigger" type="epub-spec"
                            >trigger element</olink> added to the EPUB HTML5 profile enables image or textual elements to act
                        as controls for audio and video playback (for example, to start, stop and pause playback). This
                        element eliminates the common use of scripting to include similar functionality.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The <olink targetdoc="packages" targetptr="sec-mediaType-elem" type="epub-spec">mediaType
                            element</olink> provides a means of encapsulating script-based support for rendering custom XML
                        vocabularies or other custom content types, as well as future-proofs EPUB Publications in case such
                        content types are natively supported in future Reading Systems.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The semantic inflection capability provided by the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
                            targetptr="sec-xhtml-content-type-attribute" type="epub-spec">type attribute</olink> enables
                        Authors to provide hints to Reading Systems about content properties. One use case is to define
                        elements such as images and video as having a zoomable property value, in which case a Reading System
                        could provide a means for Users to access an expanded view that is out-of-line with the normal
                        layout. Such rollover effects are typically implemented via scripting in Web contexts, but scripting
                        cannot be readily implemented given the wide variety of layouts that a Reading System might
                        generate.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para> The <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="sec-xhtml-epub-switch" type="epub-spec">switch
                            element</olink> provides a declarative means for Authors to tailor the content displayed to Users
                        without having to resort to scripted solutions.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>Ensure that you always implement best practices for accessible scripting in Web documents, such as provided
                in <xref linkend="refARIA"/>, and reserve the use of scripting for situations in which interactivity is
                critical to the User experience.</para>
