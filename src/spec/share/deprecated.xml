    <title>Deprecated and Superseded Features</title>

    <para>Features defined in EPUB are sometimes removed from the specifications if they become obsolete and/or if they are
        replaced by newer features. Sometimes such obsolete features will be removed outright during a revision, but more
        often a phased removal will occur. In these cases, the features will either be marked as deprecated or superseded
        prior to removal. The meaning of these labels is defined as follows.</para>

    <para>If a feature is marked as <emphasis>deprecated</emphasis>, the following hold true:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>The feature will be removed in a future version of the specification. The feature is marked as deprecated
                in order to give <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-author" type="epub-spec">Authors</olink> and <olink
                    targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-epub-reading-system" type="epub-spec"/> developers time to prepare for
                removal.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>It is strongly <literal role="rfc2119">recommended</literal> that Authors discontinue use of the feature in
                their <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="gloss-epub-publication" type="spec">EPUB
                Publications</olink>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Reading Systems <literal role="rfc2119">must</literal> continue to support the feature as it is defined
                until it is formally removed.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Validation tools <literal role="rfc2119">must</literal> alert Authors that inclusion of the feature is
                deprecated when encountered in an EPUB Publication. It is <literal role="rfc2119">recommended</literal> that
                the alert be lower in severity than an error or warning.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If a feature is marked as <emphasis>superseded</emphasis>, the following hold true:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>The superseded feature <literal role="rfc2119">may</literal> be removed in a future version of this
                specification, but there is no definite timeline for removal.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Authors <literal role="rfc2119">may</literal> include the superseded feature for compatibility with older
                versions of this specification, but <literal role="rfc2119">must</literal> use the replacement feature for
                conformance with this specification.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Reading Systems <literal role="rfc2119">must not</literal> support the superseded feature in content that
                conforms to this version of the specification.</para>

        <listitem>
            <para>Validation tools <literal role="rfc2119">must not</literal> alert Authors about the presence of the
                superseded feature in an EPUB Publication, as it is valid for backwards compatibility. Validation tools
                    <literal role="rfc2119">must</literal> alert Authors if the superseded feature is not conformant to its
                definition or otherwise breaks a usage requirement.</para>
