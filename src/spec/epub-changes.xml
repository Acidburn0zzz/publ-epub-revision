		<pubdate>30 January 2016</pubdate>
		<annotation>
			<title>Important Note about the First Draft</title>

			<para>The EPUB working group has opted for a radical change approach to the addition and deletion of features in
				the 3.1 revision to move the standard aggressively forward with the overarching goals of alignment with the
				Open Web Platform and simplification of the core specifications.</para>
			<para>It is expected that some of these radical changes will provoke strong reactions both for and against, as
				the working group has taken this approach to fully gauge the community response.</para>
			<para>The changes made in the first draft are not final until the revision concludes, and if strong
				negative reactions are voiced from the community they will be reviewed for future drafts.</para>
			<para>Links to the relevant open issues in the working group tracker have been included for each change listed in
				this document. To express concerns about any of these changes, please add a comment to the appropriate
				issue.</para>

			<title>EPUB 3.1 Changes from EPUB 3.0.1</title>
			<para>EPUB 3 defines the third major revision of EPUB, a digital publication interchange and delivery format
				based on XML and Web Standards. This document informatively describes the changes in EPUB 3.1 from the
				previous release, EPUB 3.0.1.</para>

		<title>Introduction</title>

		<para>EPUBÂ® is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and Web Standards. An EPUB
			Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web content that represents a digital book, magazine, or
			other type of publication, and that can be distributed for online and offline consumption. </para>

		<para>This document, EPUB 3.1 Changes from EPUB 3.0.1, describes changes made in the first major revision of the EPUB
			3.0 specifications, highlighting key changes and additions.</para>

		<para>This document is non-normative. Consult the <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="sec-epub-specs" type="epub-spec"
				>EPUB specifications</olink> for definitive information on EPUB 3.</para>

			<title>EPUB Revision History</title>

			<para>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure (OEBPS). OEBPS
				1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later became the International Digital
				Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002
				respectively.</para>

			<para> It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as well as
				interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS, which was approved by
				the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0 revision of OEBPS began in parallel which
				was approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007, consisting of a triumvirate of specifications: Open
				Package Format (OPF), Open Publication Format (OPF) together with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to
				the 2.0 specification set primarily intended clarify and correct errata in the specifications, was approved
				in September, 2010. <xref linkend="refOPF2"/>
				<xref linkend="refOPS2"/>
				<xref linkend="refOCF2"/></para>

			<para>Work on a major new 3.0 revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
				more closely with HTML5, and in the process bringing new, native multimedia features, sophisticated CSS
				layout rendering and font embedding, scripted interactivity, enhanced global language support, and improved
				accessibility. A new specification, EPUB Media Overlays was also introduced, enabling text and audio
				synchronization in EPUB Publications. To better align the specification names with the standard, the Open
				Package Format specification was renamed EPUB Publications and the Open Publication Format specification was
				renamed EPUB Content Documents. The EPUB 3.0 specifications were approved in October, 2011. <xref
					linkend="refPublications30"/>
				<xref linkend="refContentDocs30"/>
				<xref linkend="refOCF30"/>
				<xref linkend="refOverlays30"/></para>

			<para>The EPUB 3.0.1 revision was undertaken in 2013-14. Although introducing mostly minor fixes and updates, it
				did see the integration of fixed layouts. <xref linkend="refPublications301"/>

	<chapter xml:id="sec-reorg">
		<title>Specification Reorganization</title>

		<para>To simplify reading and referencing of EPUB, a major reorganization of the specifications was undertaken in
			this revision. Foremost among the changes, a new umbrella <olink targetdoc="spec" type="epub-spec"
				targetptr="sec-overview" epub:specref-exclude="true">EPUB 3.1 specification</olink> was introduced as the
			primary point of entry. EPUB Publication and Reading System requirements that were formerly defined in <xref
				linkend="refPublications301"/> were moved to this new top-level specification, as was the section on
			Publication Resources. These changes were intended to remove confusion that EPUB Publications are equivalent to
			the Package Document. All <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="sec-terminology" type="epub-spec"
				epub:specref-exclude="true">common terminology</olink> was collected into this top-level specification, as
			well, to provide a common point of reference. An <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="index" type="epub-spec"
				epub:specref-exclude="true">index of key concepts</olink> and terms was also added to aid navigation of the
			various sub-specifications.</para>

		<para>EPUB Publications 3.0.1 <xref linkend="refPublications301"/> was renamed to <olink targetdoc="packages"
				targetptr="sec-overview" type="epub-spec" epub:specref-exclude="true">EPUB Packages 3.1</olink> to better
			reflect that it defines Renditions of content. The EPUB Navigation Document definition was moved from EPUB
			Content Documents 3.0.1 <xref linkend="refContentDocs301"/> to this specification as it is a central component of
			a Package and not a feature to be implemented in EPUB Content Documents. All property definitions previously
			defined within this specification were moved out to the <xref linkend="refEPUBPackageVocab"/>.</para>

		<para>The Media Overlays specification <xref linkend="refOverlays3"/> also saw its embedded property definitions
			removed to a separate vocabulary, but was otherwise unchanged structurally.</para>

		<para>EPUB Content Documents <xref linkend="refContentDocs3"/> underwent mostly cosmetic changes outside of the
			removal of the EPUB Navigation Document definition. Some sections were renamed to better reflect that they are
			not unique document types but ways of enhancing content documents (e.g., the section "Scripted Content Documents"
			was changed to "Scripting"), but otherwise the arrangement of sections remains largely unchanged.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Clarification of Foreign Resource Fallbacks</title>
			<para>EPUB 3.1 adds an additional clarification that foreign resources <olink targetdoc="spec"
					targetptr="sec-foreign-restrictions" type="epub-spec">do not require fallbacks</olink> if they are not in
				the spine and not embedded in EPUB Content Documents.</para>
			<para>This change will allow authors to include data files for use by scripts without unnecessary fallbacks, for
				example.</para>

		<title>Packages 3.1</title>

		<section>
			<title>Package Metadata Changes</title>

			<para>EPUB 3.1 redefines a new minimal set of metadata in the package document that is intended only for use by
				reading systems in the cataloguing and display to users. One dc:identifier and dc:title, one or more
				dc:language, zero or more dc:creator, one optional dc:publisher and zero or more dc:type elements are now
				allowed. All other DCMES elements have been removed. If authors wish to include more detailed bibliographic
				metadata, they are now encouraged to use the link element to attach records.</para>
			<para>EPUB 3.1 also changes the precedence order of linked records, <olink targetdoc="packages"
					targetptr="sec-link-elem" type="epub-spec">prioritizing bibliographic information in linked
					records</olink> over the information included directly in the Package Document metadata element.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Removal of the NCX</title>

			<para>EPUB 3.1 does not support the inclusion of the EPUB 2 NCX file for navigation (cf. <link
					xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#ncx-superseded">EPUB 3.0.1
					NCX</link>). The toc attribute for referencing the file is not part of the Package Document
				grammar.</para>

						xlink:href="https://github.com/IDPF/epub-revision/issues/633">Issue #633</link>.</para>

		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Removal of the <markup>bindings</markup> Element</title>

			<para>EPUB 3.1 does not support the use of bindings in the Package Document to provide an alternative scripted
				fallback for foreign resources embedded in an object element (cf. <link
					xlink:href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-bindings-elem">EPUB 3.0.1
						<markup>bindings</markup></link>).</para>
			<para>The object element's intrinsic fallback mechanism (embedded content) remains for providing a Core Media
				Type fallback.</para>

		<title>Content Documents 3.1</title>

		<section>
			<title>Addition of Support for HTML Syntax of HTML5</title>

			<para>EPUB 3.1 adds the HTML syntax of HTM5 as a <olink targetdoc="spec" targetptr="cmt-html" type="epub-spec"
					>core media type</olink>. <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="confreq-html-rs-behavior-syntax"
					type="epub-spec">Reading Systems have to support</olink> both the HTML and XHTML syntaxes of HTML5.
				Authors <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="confreq-cd-html-docprops-syntax" type="epub-spec">can use
					either syntax</olink> for the content, and may mix documents with different syntaxes in the same
				publication.</para>
			<para>A primary result of this change is that the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
					targetptr="sec-epub-type-attribute" type="epub-spec">epub:type attribute</olink> (usable only in the
				XHTML syntax) has been superseded by the <olink targetdoc="contentdocs"
					targetptr="sec-html-aria-role-attribute" type="epub-spec">ARIA role attribute</olink>.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Replacement of EPUB Style Sheets with CSS References</title>

			<para>EPUB 3.1 removes the EPUB Style Sheets profile definition. In its place, more general CSS support
				requirements are being included.</para>

		</section>

		<section>
			<title>Scripting Support Clarifications</title>

			<para>EPUB 3.1 makes the following changes to scripting support in Reading Systems: they should support
				container-constrained scripting (down from a must because of security and privacy concerns around scripting);
				they should support spine-level scripting in fixed layout documents and the "scrolled" and
				"scrolled-continuous" interfaces defined by the rendition:flow property.</para>
			<para>Container-constrained scripting is limited to iframes (removed embed and object).</para>
			<para>A new uiVisible property is added to the epubReadingSystem object to allow scripts to query whether the
				Reading System chrome is currently being displayed.</para>

		<section>
			<title>Addition of WCAG Support</title>

			<para>Previously, only Scripted Content Documents were recommended to conform to WCAG. EPUB 3.1 now recommends
				that all HTML Content Documents <olink targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="confreq-cd-html-accessibility"
					type="epub-spec" epub:specref-exclude="true">conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA</olink>. The <olink
					targetdoc="contentdocs" targetptr="confreq-cd-svg-accessibility" type="epub-spec"
					epub:specref-exclude="true">recommendation for SVG Content Documents</olink> to conform to the SVG
				Accessibility Note has been updated to reference WCAG.</para>
