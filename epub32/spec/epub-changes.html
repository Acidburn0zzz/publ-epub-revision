			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>EPUB® is an interchange and delivery format for digital publications, based on XML and Web Standards. An
				EPUB Publication can be thought of as a reliable packaging of Web content that represents a digital
				book, magazine, or other type of publication, and that can be distributed for online and offline
				consumption. </p>

			<p>This document is non-normative. Consult the <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-epub-specs">EPUB

				<h2>Note about EPUB 3.1</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 can be considered as a successor to both EPUB 3.0.1 and EPUB 3.1. While reverting certain
					incompatible changes to EPUB 3.0.1 that EPUB 3.1 introduced, it also retains most of the rest of the
					revisions that were made to EPUB 3.1.</p>

				<p>Since EPUB 3.1 did not receive widespread adoption, the community group has decided to retain a list
					of all changes made during the EPUB 3.1 revision that are still reflected in EPUB 3.2. This decision
					was made to simplify comprehension of what has changed since EPUB 3.0.1 (i.e., readers do not have
					to review EPUB 3.1 before being able to determine how this new version updates EPUB 3.0.1).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-diff-intro-history">
				<h2>EPUB Revision History</h2>

				<section>
					<h3>OEB, OCF and EPUB 2: 1999—2010</h3>

					<p>EPUB had its roots in the interchange format known as the Open EBook Publication Structure
						(OEBPS). OEBPS 1.0 was approved in 1999 by the Open eBook Forum, an organization that later
						became the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Subsequent revisions 1.1 and 1.2 were
						approved by the IDPF in 2001 and 2002 respectively.</p>

					<p> It was realized that a need existed for a format standard that could be used for delivery as
						well as interchange, and work began in late 2005 on a single-file container format for OEPBS,
						which was approved by the IDPF as the OEBPS Container Format (OCF) in 2006. Work on a 2.0
						revision of OEBPS began in parallel which was approved as the renamed EPUB 2.0 in October, 2007,
						consisting of a triumvirate of specifications: Open Package Format (OPF), Open Publication
						Format (OPF) together with OCF. EPUB 2.0.1, a maintenance update to the 2.0 specification set
						primarily intended clarify and correct errata in the specifications, was approved in September,
						2010. [[OPF2]] [[OPS2]] [[OCF2]]</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>EPUB 3.0–3.0.1: 2010–2014</h3>

					<p>Work on a major revision of the EPUB specifications began in 2010, with the goal of aligning EPUB
						more closely with HTML, and in the process bringing new, native multimedia features,
						sophisticated CSS layout rendering and font embedding, scripted interactivity, enhanced global
						language support, and improved accessibility. A new specification, EPUB Media Overlays was also
						introduced, enabling text and audio synchronization in EPUB Publications. To better align the
						specification names with the standard, the Open Package Format specification was renamed EPUB
						Publications and the Open Publication Format specification was renamed EPUB Content Documents.
						The EPUB 3.0 specifications were approved in October, 2011. [[Publications30]] [[ContentDocs30]]
						[[OCF30]] [[MediaOverlays30]]</p>

					<p>The EPUB 3.0.1 revision was undertaken in 2013-14. Although introducing mostly minor fixes and
						updates, it did see the integration of Fixed Layout Documents, which give Authors greater
						control over presentation when a reflowable EPUB is not suitable for the content.
						[[Publications301]] [[ContentDocs301]] [[OCF301]] [[MediaOverlays301]]</p>

		<section id="sec-reorg">
			<h1>Specification Reorganization</h1>

			<p>To simplify reading and referencing of the EPUB standard, a major reorganization of the specifications
				was undertaken. Foremost among the changes, a new umbrella <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-overview">EPUB
					3.2 specification</a> was introduced as the primary point of entry. EPUB Publication and Reading
				System requirements that were formerly defined in [[Publications301]] were moved to this new top-level
				specification, as was the section on <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-publication-resources">Publication
					Resources</a>. All <a href="epub-spec.html#sec-terminology">common terminology</a> were collected
				into this top-level specification, as well, to provide a common point of reference. An <a
					href="epub-spec.html#index">index of key concepts</a> and terms was also added to aid navigation of
				the various sub-specifications.</p>

			<p>[[Publications301]] was renamed to <a href="epub-packages.html#sec-overview">EPUB Packages 3.2</a> to
				better reflect that it defines Renditions of content through the Package Document. The EPUB Navigation
				Document definition was moved from [[ContentDocs301]] to the Packages specification as it is a central
				component of a Package and not a general feature of EPUB Content Documents. Property definitions
				previously defined within this specification were moved out to external vocabularies.</p>

			<p>[[MediaOverlays32]] also has its embedded property definitions moved to a separate vocabulary, but is
				otherwise unchanged structurally.</p>

			<p>[[ContentDocs32]] underwent mostly cosmetic changes outside of the removal of the EPUB Navigation
				Document definition. Some sections are renamed to better reflect that they are not unique document types
				but ways of enhancing content documents (e.g., the section "Scripted Content Documents" was changed to
				"Scripting"), but otherwise the arrangement of sections remains largely unchanged.</p>

			<p>[[OCF32]] similarly underwent some minor editorial and structural cleanup, but no sections were added or
				removed.</p>

			<section id="sec-epub32-a11y">
				<h2>Accessibility Support</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 includes a recommendation that all EPUB Publications conform to the new EPUB Accessibility
					Specification [[EPUBAccessibility]]. The accessibility specification makes recommendations for the
					inclusion of discovery metadata along with [[WCAG20]] support in content.</p>

				<p>EPUB Reading Systems are also recommended to meet the requirements in [[EPUBAccessibility]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-cmt">
				<h2>New Core Media Types</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 adds the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/cmt/v3/#cmt-woff2">WOFF 2.0</a> and <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/cmt/v3/#cmt-sfnt">SFNT</a> font formats as Core Media Types
					[[CoreMediaTypes]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-fallbacks">
				<h2>Clarification of Foreign Resource Fallbacks</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 adds an additional clarification that foreign resources <a
						href="epub-spec.html#sec-foreign-restrictions">do not require fallbacks</a> if they are not in
					the spine and not embedded in EPUB Content Documents.</p>
				<p>This change will allow authors to include data files for use by scripts without unnecessary
					fallbacks, among other benefits.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-res">
				<h2>Remotely-Hosted Resources</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.2 allows fonts and resources used by scripts to be <a
						href="epub-spec.html#sec-resource-locations">hosted outside the EPUB Container</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-epub32-cfi">
				<h2>Removed support for EPUBCFI for linking</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 removes the requirement for Reading Systems to support EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifiers
					[[EPUB-CFI]] for hyperlinking (cf. the <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#confreq-rs-cfi">EPUB 3.0.1

				<h2>The <code>refines</code> attribute</h2>

				<p>Use of the <a href="epub-packages.html#attrdef-meta-refines"><code>refines</code> attribute</a>
					[[Packages32]] is now <a href="epub-spec.html#deprecated">deprecated</a>. The following attributes
					have been added to replace the functionality it provided to Reading Systems: <code>duration</code>,
						<code>opf:alt-rep</code>, <code>opf:authority</code>, <code>opf:file-as</code>,
						<code>opf:role</code>, <code>opf:scheme</code> and <code>opf:term</code>.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The new <code>opf:scheme</code> attribute is similar in name and purpose to the existing
							<code>scheme</code> attribute allowed on the <code>meta</code> tag, but is limited to
						identifying identifier schemes. The attribute was previously allowed in EPUB 2, and
						compatibility was a consideration in retaining the prefixed name, as was keeping all attributes
						allowed on the [[DC11]] elements in the <code>opf:</code> namespace. These benefits were seen to
						outweigh any initial authoring confusion that might arise.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-pkg-linked-records">
				<h2>Linked Metadata Records</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 also changes the precedence order of linked records, <a
						href="epub-packages.html#sec-link-elem">prioritizing bibliographic information in linked
						records</a> over the information included directly in the Package Document <code>metadata</code>
					element.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A protocol for retrieving remote records was under development in an appendix in the last draft.
						That work has been removed and will be continued in a separate document.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-pkg-opf2-meta">
				<h2>Removal of the OPF2 <code>meta</code> Element</h2>


				<p>EPUB 3.1 removes the [[OPF2]] <code>meta</code> element (cf. <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-opf-meta-elem">OPF2
							<code>meta</code> element</a> in EPUB 3.0.1).</p>

			<section id="sec-pkg-ncx">
				<h2>NCX is Marked for Removal</h2>

				<p>The EPUB 2 NCX file for navigation is now <a href="epub-spec.html#superseded-removal">marked for
						removal</a> (cf. <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#ncx-superseded">EPUB 3.0.1
						NCX</a>). Support for it will be removed in the next major revision of EPUB.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-pkg-guide">
				<h2>Removal of the <code>guide</code> Element</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 removes the deprecated <code>guide</code> element (cf. <a

							<code>guide</code> element</a>).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="sec-pkg-bindings">
				<h2>Removal of the <code>bindings</code> Element</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 does not support the use of bindings in the Package Document to provide an alternative
					scripted fallback for foreign resources embedded in an object element (cf. <a
						href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-bindings-elem">EPUB 3.0.1
							<code>bindings</code></a>).</p>
				<p>The [[HTML]] <code>object</code> element's <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-xhtml-fallbacks"

			</div>

			<section id="sec-cdoc-undated">
				<h2>Undated References to HTML and SVG</h2>


				<p>EPUB 3.0.1 used dated reference to HTML 5.0 and SVG 1.1, which tied the specification to those
					specific versions. Under this model, a new revision was required each time a version of HTML or SVG
					was introduced.</p>

				<p>To ensure that that EPUB 3.1 remains up to date with the latest recommended versions of these
					specifications, the dated references have been replaced with undated references in EPUB 3.1. This
					change means that as new recommended versions of HTML and SVG are published, they are immediately
					valid for use in EPUB Publications.</p>

				<p>For more information, see <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-overview-relations-html">Relationship to
						HTML</a> and <a href="epub-contentdocs.html#sec-overview-relations-svg">Relationship to
					SVG</a>.</p>

			<section id="sec-cdoc-css">
				<h2>Replacement of EPUB Style Sheets with CSS References</h2>

				<p>EPUB 3.1 removes the EPUB Style Sheets profile. In its place, more general <span class="phrase"><a

					defined:</p>

				<div class="itemizedlist">

				<div class="itemizedlist">
					<ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">

							<p>Container-constrained scripting is limited to the [[HTML]] <code>iframe</code> element
								(removed <code>embed</code> and <code>object</code>).</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems should support container-constrained scripting (down from "must" because
								of security and privacy concerns around scripting)</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Reading Systems should support spine-level scripting in fixed layout documents and the
								"scrolled-doc" and "scrolled-continuous" interfaces defined by the <a
